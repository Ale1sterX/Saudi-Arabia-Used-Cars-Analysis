# Saudi Arabia Used Car Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts **used car prices** in Saudi Arabia using various features such as brand, model year, mileage, and engine size.  
The model is trained using **XGBoost** and includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretability with SHAP.

## 📊 Business Understanding

The Saudi Arabian used car market has rapidly grown, and understanding price patterns can help both **buyers** and **sellers** make informed decisions.  
This project aims to provide an interpretable model that estimates fair prices for used vehicles.

**Objectives:**
- Identify key factors influencing car prices  
- Build a predictive model with strong generalization performance  
- Explain model predictions using SHAP values

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model training with **XGBoost**  
- Hyperparameter tuning with **RandomizedSearchCV**  
- Evaluation with **RMSE** and **R² Score**  
- Model interpretability using **SHAP**  

---

## Insights
- Car **brand**, **model year**, and **mileage** are major predictors of price.  
- Newer cars and premium brands (e.g., BMW, Mercedes) show higher resale value.  
- SHAP analysis highlights feature contributions per prediction.
